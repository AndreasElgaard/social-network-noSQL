# Social Network

This project was implemented to get familira with noSQL. 

It is a social network where a user can choose to follow another user.
Furthermore a user can create ‘circles’ of users of which the user can share update, as a extra
layer of privacy. So a post is only visible if the the post is posted in a circle which the user is
member of or public.
